# Capstone #1 Proposal
## Rain or Shine - NFL


Problem
They say West coast teams cannot play on the East in winter, but is that an opinion or is there data to support this statement? There are many factors that contribute if a team is going to win or not, but can you predict the winner of an NFL game based on the weather? Does the type of stadium (indoor/outdoor, turf/grass) a team plays in aid in their probability of winning?  Using historical data for past NFL games (home/visiting team, score, type of stadium, weather, location) to find a correlation between these factors as well as a predictive model to predict the winner/loser of games.


Audience
Sports analytics has become popular in mainstream sports in this past decade. Sports teams have started to use analytics to aid in their decision making and preparation. Sports gambling from fantasy leagues to betting have also seen a significant impact from sports analytics. This project will benefit various fields involved in the NFL, from teams themselves, fantasy football players, to sports bettors. They will be able to use this project to better predict outcomes of games.


Data
The data consists of historical NFL data from 1966 to 2019. Team and stadium data have various columns, the main focus will be on stadium and field type, as well as location. Game data during the date range is also included from various public websites such as ESPN, NFL.com, and Pro Football Reference. This dataset consists of multiple columns for game analysis including teams playing, stadium, score, and weather data. The weather information is provided from NOAA data. 


Approach
Predictive modeling will be used to solve the problem stated above. An analysis will be done to see if there are any correlations between various game factors. A model will be created based on this analysis to predict future outcomes. 


The approach during the exploratory data analysis phase will be hypothesis-driven.  The hypothesis tree which will be used is provided below in Figure 1. Once it is determined which features are relevant, several machine learning models will be trained and evaluated on the performance

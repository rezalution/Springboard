##A Picture Speaks a Billion Words

**Problem**

Studios live and die off of the outcomes of their movies. A blockbuster can doom a studio to close or set it up for future projects. With such big consequences is there any way for a studio to predict if their movie will succeed or fail? Will certain factors contribute or hurt its success? In this project I will be using a variety of movie data including budget, revenue, genre, and movie poster to see if I can predict the overall success of a movie. A main focus will be to see if a movie poster has features that correlate to a movies success.

**Audience**

This project will benefit studios and other in the film industry to aid them in their decisions and analysis of films. They will be able to use the models to hopefully inform them and guide them in the right direction.

**Approach**

Exploratory data analysis will be used to get insights and patterns on the data. As well as get an overall view of what the data holds. From there statistics will be used to find correlations between different factors and a preliminary analysis of the data. Finally machine learning analysis will be conducted on the data through gradient boosting classification and regression to train and test the data to predict the success of the movies.
